  \summary
    {I am a passionate and caring \textbf{Technical Engineering Manager}. I aim to inspire my team through genuine enthusiasm for our work. I am always ready to step in and help solve technical challenges directly when needed but will never miss a teaching opportunity. I will block and tackle for my team while building bridges with stakeholders and growing lasting cross-functional partnerships. I can easily and clearly articulate technical requirements and constraints to non technical stakeholders. If the developers on my team are not growing then I am not doing my job.
